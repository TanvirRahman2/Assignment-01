          <p> Samsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra is finally on sale, and there are quite a few reasons you may want to buy it. This year's Ultra comes with a new titanium frame, lots of fresh AI-powered features and upgrades to the all-important chipset, display and camera components.There's no argument that the Galaxy S24 Ultra is still the top Galaxy S24 series, even as the cheaper devices in the line-up get some upgrades of their own. However, some of the S24 Ultra's specs are still very similar to what the Galaxy S23 Ultra offers, although perhaps through further use more of a performance gap will appear between the new device and last year's.</p>
